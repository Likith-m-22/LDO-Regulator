# 🔌 Likith’s 5V → 3.3V LDO Regulator (MIC5317)  
*A beginner PCB design created to learn Altium Designer*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a compact **Low Dropout (LDO) voltage regulator** that converts **5V to 3.3V** using the **MIC5317-3.3YM5** regulator.  
I built this project primarily to understand **Altium Designer**, including schematic design, PCB layout, routing, silkscreen, design rules, and generating manufacturing files.

This board is ideal for powering **3.3V sensors, microcontrollers, RF modules, and small embedded devices**.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

- Learn how to design a schematic in **Altium Designer**  
- Assign real component footprints  
- Route high-quality PCB traces  
- Follow LDO layout guidelines  
- Generate Gerber/NC drill files  
- Produce 2D/3D renders  
- Create clean documentation for GitHub  

This is my **first complete PCB design**, and it was built from scratch using Altium.
